        <h2 class="article-subheading">What is a Buoyancy Compensator?</h2>
        <p>A buoyancy compensator (BC), buoyancy control device (BCD) or buoyancy regulator (BR) is a piece of diving
            equipment containing an inflatable bladder which is worn by divers to establish neutral buoyancy underwater
            and positive buoyancy at the surface, when needed. The buoyancy is usually controlled by adjusting the
            volume of gas in the bladder, either by inflating it from the diver's primary breathing gas cylinder, or by
            releasing gas to the environment. They also provide the capacity to float the diver at the surface before,
            during and after the dive. The great majority of buoyancy compensators are attached to the scuba set by
            fitting the cylinder into a pocket or sleeve in the BC and securing it with straps, and are worn on the
            back, but other arrangements are available.</p>

        <h2 class="article-subheading">Function of the BCD</h2>
        <p>The primary function of the buoyancy compensator is to adjust the buoyancy of the diver during the dive. This
            allows the diver to achieve neutral buoyancy at a given depth, so that a relaxed diver will neither sink nor
            float. The BC is used to compensate for the changes in buoyancy due to compression of the wetsuit and other
            equipment with depth, and for the reduction in effective weight of the scuba set as the breathing gas is
            used up. It also allows the diver to remain at the surface without effort before and after the dive, and to
            control the rate of ascent and descent in conjunction with diving cylinder valves and breathing.</p>

        <h2 class="article-subheading">Operating the BCD</h2>
        <p>The buoyancy of the BC is usually controlled by a combination of a low pressure direct feed from the primary
            breathing gas regulator first stage, an inflator valve, an oral inflation option, and one or more
            overpressure and dump valves. The direct feed uses an inflator hose to supply gas on demand from the
            cylinder to the bladder, and gas can be released either through the overpressure valves, which will vent
            when the internal pressure exceeds the external pressure by a small amount, or through a dump valve, which
            is manually opened to release gas, or by the diver using the oral inflation option to release gas through
            the mouthpiece.</p>
