        <h2 class="article-subheading">What Are Clownfish?</h2>
        <p>Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty
            species of clownfish are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the remaining are in the genus
            Amphiprion. In the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species,
            anemonefish are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white stripes outlined
            in black. Anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the Indian Ocean, including the Andaman Sea, and
            Pacific Ocean, the Great Barrier Reef, Southeast Asia, Japan, and the Malay Archipelago. While most species
            have restricted distributions, others are widespread. Anemonefish typically live at the bottom of shallow
            seas in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. There are no anemonefish in the Atlantic.</p>

        <h2 class="article-subheading">Symbiosis with Sea Anemones</h2>
        <p>Anemonefish are easily recognisable by their bright orange colour, white stripes and black outline, and are
            among the most recognizable fish on coral reefs. They are not strong swimmers, and live among sea anemones,
            which protect them from predators with their venomous tentacles, to which the anemonefish are immune. In
            return, the anemonefish clean the anemone of parasites, provide it with nutrients through their waste, and
            ward off potential predators of the anemone, such as butterflyfish. The relationship between anemonefish and
            sea anemones is a classic example of mutualism in nature.</p>

        <h2 class="article-subheading">Reproduction of Clownfish</h2>
        <p>In a group of anemonefish, a strict dominance hierarchy exists. The largest and most aggressive fish is
            female and is found at the top. Only two anemonefish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce â€“ through
            external fertilization. Anemonefish are protandrous sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they are born as
            males, but the dominant male in a group will change into a female if the resident female dies, while the
            other fish remain male. This unique reproductive strategy allows for flexibility in maintaining breeding
            pairs within the group.</p>
