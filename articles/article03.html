        <h2 class="article-subheading">What is a Scuba Set?</h2>
        <p>A scuba set, originally just scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus), is any
            breathing apparatus that is entirely carried by an underwater diver and provides the diver with breathing
            gas at the ambient pressure. Scuba is overwhelmingly the most common underwater breathing system used by
            recreational divers, and is also used in professional diving when it provides advantages, usually of
            improved mobility and range, over surface-supplied diving systems, and is allowed by the relevant code of
            practice.</p>

        <h2 class="article-subheading">Components of a Scuba Set</h2>
        <p>The defining equipment of a scuba set is the diving regulator and the diving cylinder. The regulator
            typically has a primary first stage which connects to the cylinder valve, and a primary second stage
            connected to the first stage by a low pressure hose, from which the diver breathes, and usually a secondary
            second stage (the "octopus") for emergency use by a buddy diver, a submersible pressure gauge to show
            remaining gas pressure, and a low pressure hose to supply a buoyancy compensator. The cylinder is usually a
            single aluminium or steel pressure vessel, but may be a set of cylinders bolted together with a manifold, or
            a set of independent cylinders carried as a pony set or side-mount configuration.</p>

        <h2 class="article-subheading">How a Scuba Set Operates</h2>
        <p>The most common scuba set configuration in use is the "single-hose" open circuit demand system, in which
            compressed breathing gas, usually air, is stored in a cylinder carried on the diver's back, and the pressure
            is reduced to ambient by a two-stage regulator. The first stage reduces the high cylinder pressure to an
            intermediate pressure, and the second stage, which is in the diver's mouthpiece, reduces the intermediate
            pressure to ambient pressure on demand as the diver inhales. The exhaled gas is exhausted directly to the
            environment through the regulator exhaust valve, producing a flow of bubbles with each breath.</p>
